# Casper-Perl-sdk

Perl SDK library for interacting with a CSPR node.

## What is CSPR-Perl-SDK?

SDK  to streamline the 3rd party Perl client integration processes. Such 3rd parties include exchanges & app developers. 

## System requirement

The SDK use Perl 5.30.2. To run the SDK you need to have Perl 5.8.3 or above installed in your system.

## Run and test
To run Perl on specific Operating System, please refer to the Perl language main site for how to set up on each Operating System at this address: https://www.perl.org/get.html

The SDK can be built and tested in different IDEs and from command line.

For Windows user, for fast and easy installation and usage of the command line for Perl, please install "Strawberry Perl" - As the document at the Perl main page:

 A 100% Open Source Perl for Windows that is exactly the same as Perl everywhere else; this includes using modules from CPAN, without the need for binary packages. 
 
### Run and test from IDE
There are variety of IDE for Perl as described in this link: https://www.dunebook.com/best-perl-ide-and-editors/. 
In this document, we focus on how to implement the SDK in Eclipse as IDE, with EPIC add on installed.
First you need to install Eclipse from this address:
https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/
Download the Eclipse installation file (Choose the "Get Eclipse IDE 2022â€‘03"), install it, choose "Eclipse IDE for Java Developers" is good enough, as in this image below.

Then open Eclipse, and hit "Help->Eclipse Marketplace", as in this image:

Search for keyword "EPIC", you will see the first result of EPIC addon for Perl in Eclipse appears, choose to install it, as this image

Accept by clicking all the checkbox during the process of installing EPIC addon

Next restart Eclipse and now you are ready to load the Casper Perl SDK in Eclipse.

Download the Casper Perl SDK from Github, place it somewhere in your local hard drive. From Eclipse you can then import the project.

From Eclipse choose "File-> Open Projects from File System..."

Hit the "Directory" button

and choose the already downloaded Casper Perk SDK.

Click "Finish", you then will see the project in the "Package Explorer" tab of Eclipse

Double click on  the "Casper-Perl-sdk" project to expand it.
The source code for the SDK is in the "lib" folder.
The test file for the SDK is in the "t" folder.
To test for the RPC calls, expand the "t" folder. You will see a list of test file in that folder.
To test for each file, just click on each file, for example to test for "GetAuctionTest.t" file, Double click on that file. Then in Eclispe hit "Run->Run". You will see the result of the test in the Console window, like this:

Follow the same procedure, click on each test file in the "t" folder to test for RPC call that you wish to do.

### Run and test from command line
Download the Source code from Github and put it in your local computer.
From the Terminal(Mac OS) or Command Prompt (Windows) enter the root folder of the SDK. Then enter the "t" folder of the SDK.
Run this command to test for each test file in the "t" folder.

```Perl
perl "test file".
```

For example if you want to test for file "GetAuction.t" which contain all test for the "state_get_auction_info" RPC call, run this command:

```Perl
perl GetAuction.t
```
If you want to test for file "GetDeployRPCTest.t" run this command:

```Perl
perl GetDeployRPCTest.t
```

To test for all file, enter the root folder of the SDK and run this command:

```Perl
make test
```

### Run the module of the SDK

The SDK provide functionality in form of module. To use the module in other Perl project, simply copy all file/folders under the "lib" folder of the SDK and copy it under the "lib" folder of other project.

After that, you can call the function directly within the "lib" folder of project or create other file outside of the "lib" folder, for example in the root directory of the project, then call the class/function of the Casper SDK in the "lib" folder.

Detail of how to call the module function of the SDK from other files:

Create 1 simple project in Perl by create 1 folder, for example let call it "SamplePerlProject" and make the same folder "SamplePerlProject" somewhere in your hard disk.

Create a folder with name "lib" under the "SamplePerlProject" folder.

Copy all the file/folder under the "lib" folder of the Casper-Perl-sdk SDK to the "lib" folder under "SamplePerlProject" folder.

Under "SamplePerlProject" folder create 1 Perl file with name "sampleCall.pl" with the following content, just to implement the call for "chain_get_state_root_hash" RPC call.

```Perl
#!/usr/bin/perl
$ENV{'PERL_LWP_SSL_VERIFY_HOSTNAME'} = 0;
use strict;
use warnings;
use FindBin qw( $RealBin );
use lib "$RealBin/lib";
use GetStateRootHash::GetStateRootHashRPC;
use Common::ConstValues;
use Common::BlockIdentifier;
sub testFunc {
	my $bi = new Common::BlockIdentifier();
	# Test 1: Call with block hash
	$bi->setBlockType("hash");
	$bi->setBlockHash("d16cb633eea197fec519aee2cfe050fe9a3b7e390642ccae8366455cc91c822e");
	my $postParamStr = $bi->generatePostParam($Common::ConstValues::RPC_GET_STATE_ROOT_HASH);
	my $getStateRootHashRPC = new GetStateRootHash::GetStateRootHashRPC();
	my $stateRootHash1 = $getStateRootHashRPC->getStateRootHash($postParamStr);
	print $stateRootHash1;
}
testFunc();
```
